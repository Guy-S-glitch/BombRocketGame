# Bombs and Rockets
Bombs and rockets Game is my first project as a developer using only c#.
the game is a concept based on the game "Ladders and snakes" where rockets represent ladders and instead of snakes there is bombs. the idea is similar, however landing on rocket gains you randomly 1-6 spaces but bomb makes you lose randomly 1-12 space. 
first player to land on the 100 block wins and the game end. then you'll also see who was second,third etc. according to the amount of players chosen.
you can exit the game and return to the menu at any point.

# Requriments
