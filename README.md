# Bombs and Rockets
Bombs and rockets Game is my first project as a developer using only c#.
the game is a concept based on the game "Ladders and snakes" where rockets represent ladders and instead of snakes there is bombs. the idea is similar, however the effect is random. bombs potentially effect you twice the amount rockets can. game for 1-6 players.
